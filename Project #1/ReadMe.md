Div, Header, Footer and Main
Project #1

Part 1: Write the HTML
 
We didn't cover all the possible HTML tags yet. What are they? And what should they be used for?

For this project you should:

1. Find a resource online that gives you a list of each HTML tag that you can use.
2. Pick 5 of those tags (5 that we have not covered so far).
3. Create a simple website about your favorite book / story, and include those 5 tags in the HTML. (The page can have any other tags as well, as long as those 5 are included). This can take any form. You can get as complicated or as simple as you wish.
4. Add comments to each section of your code, explaining the purpose of that block.

For extra credit, use one or more of these tags (if you haven't already):

1. <video>
2. <audio>
3. <form>
4. <select>
5. <input>
6. <base>
7. <meta>
8. <iframe>

Part 2: Save the HTML

Once you have created your document, save the file as a ".html" file. For example, the name of the file could be "recipe.html" or "homework.html" etc.

If you are using JS Bin to compose your code, you should be able to find an "export" or "download" option from the menu. You may need to be logged-in to JSbin for that to work. If that doesn't work for you, then simply select and copy your code from JS Bin, then paste it into a text editor, and save the document as an HTML file (with the .html extension). If you don't have a text editor installed on your machine, we recommend you download and use Atom, Sublime, Visual Studio Code, or Notepad++.


Part 3: Share Your Work and Teach Others [OPTIONAL]

It's time to share your work with the world, and teach others what you learned. Write up a short explanation (1-2 paragraphs) of the code you created. Explain what you learned in the course so far, and then explain how your code works.

Then, take your explanation and create a post online that shares your code and the writeup. This could be any of the options below:

Pick one of these options 

1. A blog post / Medium post
2. A reddit post
3. A tweet
4. An instagram post or story
5. A facebook post or story
6. A LinkedIn post
7. A youtube video / screenshare
8. A facebook video / screenshare
9. A Snapchat or Tiktok video

Pick the option that works for you. Get creative! Once you're done, take screenshots of the post/video you created.

Note: Creating a post in our Student Forum does not count, as the purpose of the assignment is to teach the public, not our current students.

Part 4: Zip and Upload Everything

Create an empty folder on your desktop. In that folder, put the following items:

1. Your HTML file
2. The local images that are referenced in your HTML (if any)
3. The screenshots of your post (if any)

Then, create a zip file out of that folder, and upload the zip file below. If you don't know how to create a zip file, please read these instructions. Please allow 1 business day for us to manually review the files you upload. 
Submit your assignment
You may only submit one file with maximum 100 MB in size
